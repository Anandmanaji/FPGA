## FPGA BRAM Projects
This repository contains various Block RAM (BRAM) configurations implemented as part of my FPGA course using Xilinx Vivado. These projects explore different RAM architectures and configurations suitable for FPGA-based memory systems.

### Projects Overview
#### 1. Single-Port BRAM: 2048 x 16
Description: Traditional single-port BRAM allowing one read/write operation at a time.
<br>
Configuration: 2048 words × 16 bits
<br>
Use Case: Simple memory structures with minimal access conflict.

#### 2. Dual-Port BRAM: 32 x 16K
Description: Dual-port block RAM allowing simultaneous access via two ports.
<br>
Configuration: 32 bits × 16K locations
<br>
Use Case: Applications requiring concurrent read/write operations.

#### 3. Distributed RAM: 256 x 32
Description: Implements a small distributed memory using LUTs.
<br>
Configuration: 256 words × 32 bits
<br>
Use Case: High-speed, low-capacity memory applications.

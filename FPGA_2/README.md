# Session 2: FPGA Projects
Projects Completed: Counter and 3-Bit Multiplier
These projects were implemented as part of the second session of the FPGA course, using Verilog HDL and Xilinx Vivado for simulation and schematic generation.

## Project 1: Binary Counter using D Flip-Flops
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a binary counter built entirely using D-type flip-flops (D-FFs). The counter is developed in Verilog and synthesized using Vivado, targeting a configurable 3-bit or 4-bit counting range.

### Key Features:
Designed with synchronous D flip-flops to store binary state.
Increments on every positive clock edge.
Supports asynchronous or synchronous reset for initialization.
Implemented as a synchronous counter to avoid clock skew/race issues.

### Testing & Verification:
Simulation was carried out in Vivado's built-in simulator.
Functionality such as proper bit toggling, carry propagation, and reset behavior were verified.
The waveform confirms accurate and glitch-free counting operation.

## Project 2: 3-Bit Binary Multiplier using Half Adders
This project demonstrates the structural design of a 3-bit binary multiplier using Half Adders and basic logic gates, implemented in Verilog HDL and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado.

The multiplier accepts two 3-bit binary inputs and generates a 6-bit product by performing bitwise operations and structured addition of partial products using Half Adders. This design reflects the classic paper-and-pencil multiplication method, re-created in hardware using fundamental components.

### Key Design Highlights:
Implemented using only Half Adders and AND gates—no built-in multiplication.
Developed entirely at the gate-level (structural modeling) in Verilog.
Synthesis completed successfully using Vivado, confirming the design’s hardware realizability.
Generated schematic shows the internal netlist and structure post-synthesis.

## Project 3: 2-Input AND Gate Using D Flip-Flops
This project demonstrates how to implement a basic 2-input AND gate using only D-type flip-flops (D-FFs), designed in Verilog HDL and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado.

While an AND gate is typically implemented using a single logic gate, this project focuses on realizing the logic behavior using sequential logic elements (D-FFs), thereby highlighting how combinational functionality can be reconstructed from sequential building blocks.

### Design Concept:
The AND gate outputs 1 only when both inputs A and B are high.
Instead of using a direct assign statement or built-in AND operator, the design uses D flip-flops to capture the inputs and then compute the output logic based on their registered values.
This helps in understanding how sequential elements can be creatively used to build combinational logic.

### Implementation Details:
Inputs: A, B (1-bit each)
Output: Y = A AND B (realized through D-FF behavior)
Clock-driven design captures A and B into flip-flops and generates the AND-ed output in a controlled manner.
